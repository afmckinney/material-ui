Micro:bit is a computing platform from the BBC. It is an open platform for developing all manner of projects and is programmable by a number of different editors, including a [blocks editor](https://pxt.microbit.org) provided by Microsoft.

MIT App Inventor provides an extension bundle for interacting with the Micro:bit. The Micro:bit reference documentation includes the following extensions:

* [Microbit_Accelerometer](#/components/microbitaccelerometer) to access the Micro:bit's onboard accelerometer.
* [Microbit_Button](#/components/microbitbutton) to receive messages when the Micro:bit's buttons are pressed.
* [Microbit_Io_Pin](#/components/microbitiopin) to configure the onboard pins of the Micro:bit and read/write analog and digital values from those pins.
* [Microbit_Led](#/components/microbitled) to print strings and custom images to the Micro:bit's LED matrix.
* [Microbit_Magnetometer](#/components/microbitmagnetometer) to getting heading/bearing information from the Micro:bit.
* [Microbit_Temperature](#/components/microbittemperature) to get environmental temperature readings in Celsius from the Micro:bit.
* [Microbit_Uart](#/components/microbituart) to send and receive messages using the software serial port (UART) interface for the Micro:bit. This can be used to send messages to custom software installed on the Micro:bit.
